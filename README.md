### Introduction

App Icons Taskbar (azTaskbar) is a simple taskbar extension for GNOME Shell, designed to provide a more familiar user experience and workflow. This extension places app icons in the panel showing current running apps, and GNOME favorites.

Picture shown above uses [Just Perfection](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3843/just-perfection/) to increase panel size and [ArcMenu](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3628/arcmenu/) to add an application menu to the panel.
